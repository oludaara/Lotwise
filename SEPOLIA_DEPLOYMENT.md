# Sepolia Testnet Deployment Guide

## 🎉 Good News!
Your Alchemy API key is working perfectly! The deployment script successfully connected to Sepolia testnet.

## 💰 Need Sepolia ETH
Your wallet (`0xB6583A4fEcAf5d96A54b503AE29B100cddB0E89a`) needs Sepolia ETH for gas fees.

### Get Sepolia ETH from Faucets:

1. **Alchemy Faucet** (Recommended):
   - https://sepoliafaucet.com/
   - Connect your wallet
   - Request 0.5 ETH

2. **Chainlink Faucet**:
   - https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia
   - Connect wallet and request ETH

3. **Infura Faucet**:
   - https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia
   - Sign up and request testnet ETH

### After Getting Sepolia ETH:

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

The deployment will use the real Chainlink ETH/USD price feed:
- Address: `0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306`
- This provides real-time ETH/USD price data on Sepolia

## ✅ What's Ready:
